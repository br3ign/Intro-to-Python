"""
Password Manager
"""

# Week 1
"""
Create a simple program that:
    - Prompts users to enter a website, username, and password
    - Stores these credentials in variables
    - Displays the stored information back to the user
"""

# Week 2
"""
Add the following Features:
    - Add password strength checking (length, special characters, numbers)
    - Implement conditional feedback on password strength
    - Allow user to decide whether to save the password based on strength
"""

# Week 3
"""
Include the following to your program:
    - Convert to a menu-driven program with a loop
    - Store multiple sets of credentials in a list of program/service:password pair (eg. google.com:password)
    - Implement features to add, view, and search for credentials
"""

# Week 4
"""
Add the following to your program:
    - Implement saving/loading credentials to/from a file
    - Add some simple obfuscation (not true encryption yet and will require a little research)
    - Create a master password to access the application
    - Implement basic logging of access attempts

Additional actions
    - Refactor code into organized functions
    - Implement password hashing for the master password
    - Add simple encryption for stored passwords
    - Create functions for security auditing (checking for weak/duplicate passwords)
    - Implement some exception handling
    - Create secure backup/restore functionality
    - Add option to securely delete individual credentials
