'''
FizzBuzz is a common question asked in programming interviews

Write a program that prints the following:
  1. It should print from numbers 1 - 100
  2. If the number is a multiple of 3: Replace the number with the word "Fizz"
  3. If the number is a multiple of 5: Replace the number with the word "Buzz"
  4. If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5 (such as 15, and 30): Replace the number with the word "FizzBuzz"

TIPS
  - Use the range() function
  - Use the % operator
  - The range() function includes the starting number but excludes the end number
